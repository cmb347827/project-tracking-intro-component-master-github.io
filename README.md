## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap custom overrides
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Jquery
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use a single clickable element that toggles between on/off and changes image between each click using Jquery 
- I also was able to create a menu from the navigation element in mobile view
- The background shape was relatively easy. The hardest part was moving it to the correct location in the different views.
  

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
